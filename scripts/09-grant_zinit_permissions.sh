# Link for Root Access
# --------------------
# To ensure root uses the exact same configuration and shared downloads:
# 1. Link the ZDOTDIR: Root needs to know where to find the config.
# sudo mkdir -p /root/.config/zsh
# sudo ln -sf "$HOME/.config/zsh/.zshrc" /root/.config/zsh/.zshrc
# Handle the P10k Config: If you configure P10k as a user, link that too so root looks the same:
# sudo ln -sf "$HOME/.config/zsh/.p10k.zsh" /root/.config/zsh/.p10k.zsh
